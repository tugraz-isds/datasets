# Movies

## Overview 
This dataset was derived from a CC0-licensed dump of the [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/) respository (Mar 02, 2020), and contains denormalized CSV files (with ',' delimiter and simplified structure without the need for quoting) for persons, theses, publications, and conferences/journals. Note: Due to free-form conference titles and affiliations as well as a wealth of other issues, we cleaned this dataset with a mix of automatic and semi-automic data cleaning techniques.
